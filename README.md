# Hotel Bookings Analysis
This project focuses on cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing hotel booking data using Python and Power BI.
It demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow from raw booking data to business insights related to hotel operations.

##  Project Overview
In real-world hotel management systems, booking data often contains missing values, inconsistent formats, and complex customer behavior patterns.
This project shows how raw hotel booking data can be cleaned, explored, and transformed into meaningful insights that support business decision-making.

## Power BI Dashboard – Key Insights

Shows total bookings and cancellation trends across different periods.

Compares canceled vs non-canceled bookings to understand customer behavior.

Analyzes bookings by hotel type, customer type, and market segment.

Visualizes seasonal booking patterns to identify peak and low-demand periods.

Supports interactive analysis using filters such as hotel type, year, and customer category.
